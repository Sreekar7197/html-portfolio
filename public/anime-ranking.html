<h3>*NARUTO</h3>
<p>So Naruto is one of the best anime I have seen because it is the first anime that i have started watching anime from so obviously I like it the most and the story, the narration and the charecters in that anime are fabulous!</p>
<h3>*DEMON SLAYER</h3>
<p>Demon Slayer is one of the anime having insane level of animation. All the flashy colours, the characters and everything leaves the audiance with an AWE.</p>
<h3>*ATTACK ON TITAN</h3>
<p>Well coming to Attack On Titan,  this is one of the anime that has made my mind go BOOM. Like it has whole climax going on from the start only but we dont have that information to notice that it is going to get connected to the climax!!!</p>
